    /**
     * Whenever a method is declared as static then we should keep in mind these points:
     *    A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
     *    A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
     *    Static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.
     * Now, this keyword in java is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
     * Also the super keyword in java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate
     * parent class object. So, we can say that this and super both keyword are reference variable
     * that refers to some object. In other words these both keywords belong to instance of the class.
     * Whereas, static method belongs to the class than instance of the class. And so static method
     * canâ€™t access this and super keyword in java.
