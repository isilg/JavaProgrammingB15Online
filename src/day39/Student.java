        // instance field/variable :
        // Creating an instance means creating an Object
        // Create a Student object(Student is template's name) = Create an instance of Student class
        // **** Instance: it is anything under a class outside of the any method
        // Instance means it is the data that belong to the object
        // just like name belong to Karima. Karima => object , name => instance variable
        // in the StudentCreation class
        // Instance is used by Objects to store their states. Variables which are defined
        // without the STATIC keyword and are Outside any method declaration are known as instance variables.
        // Instance method(s) belong to the Object of the class not to the class i.e. they can be called after creating the Object of the class.
        // Every individual Object created from the class has its own copy of the instance method(s) of that class.

        // Any time you create a class, it will become a blueprint for object
        // And this class type can be a type for variable
        // for example String has it's own class so we can create String variable
        // and assign a String object
        // Here student become a blueprint for creating student object
        // and any student object has 3 attributes defines by instance field/variable

        // This class has 3 variables
        // Instance field/ Instance variable:
        String name;
        int age;
        char gender;
